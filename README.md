akuz-java-libs
==============

After using github for some time, I've decided to consolidate
all the Java libraries into a single repository. The main reason
being that these libraries depend on each other heavily, and so
managing the verions of each lib separately is a big hustle.
Please see LICENSE for the usage terms. Contact me, if you 
are interested in getting the code under a different license.
Description of the included libraries is coming up.
