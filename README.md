akuz-java-libs
==============

After using github for some time, I've decided to consolidate
all the Java libraries into a single repository. These libraries 
depend on each other heavily, and so managing the verions of each 
library separately is a big hustle. 
Please see README.md in individual project subfolders for details.

* `akuz-core` – broadly reusable core library
* `akuz-nlp` – natural language processing library
* `akuz-ts` – time series alignment and analysis library
* `akuz-qf` – quantitative finance library
* `akuz-ml` – machine learning library
